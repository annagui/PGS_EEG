 GWAS summary statistics were downloaded from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium webside (https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/download-results/) in November 2018 (Autism) and February 2020 (xDx).

 - EEG_PGS_gh.R is the R script for the statistical analyses testing the association between F-N N290 latency and the PGSs.
 The F-N N290 latency pre-processing is described in Tye, C. et al. Understanding the nature of face processing in early autism: A prospective study. J. Abnorm. Psychol. (2020).
 
 
 - EEG_PGS_stats.htlm is the markdown documents including comments to the code lines and plots.
